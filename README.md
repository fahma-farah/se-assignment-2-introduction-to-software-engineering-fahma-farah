Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity in software design refers to the practice of dividing a software system into distinct, self-contained units or modules, each responsible for a specific aspect of the system's functionality. 
Involves concepts like :
Cohesion-a measure that defines the degree of intra-dependability within elements of a module.The greater      cohesion the better is the program design.
Coupling-a measure that defines the level of inter-dependability among modules of a program.
Benefits of Modularity
Improved Maintainability:

Isolation of Changes: Changes in one module can be made with minimal impact on others, simplifying maintenance and reducing the risk of introducing bugs.
Easier Debugging: Isolated modules allow for easier identification and fixing of issues since the scope of debugging is limited to a specific module.
Simplified Testing: Modules can be tested independently, allowing for more thorough and focused testing procedures.
Enhanced Scalability:

Independent Development: Teams can work on different modules concurrently, speeding up development and making it easier to add new features.
Load Distribution: Different modules can be deployed on separate servers or scaled independently, improving the system’s ability to handle increased load.
Reusability: Modules can be reused across different parts of the system or in different projects, reducing the effort needed to implement new functionalities.
Flexibility and Adaptability:

Ease of Updates: Updating or replacing a module with an improved version is straightforward, as long as the module adheres to the same interface.
Integration of New Technologies: New technologies or third-party modules can be integrated into the system without requiring a complete overhaul.
Parallel Development:

Team Collaboration: Different teams or developers can work on different modules simultaneously without interfering with each other’s work.
Specialization: Developers can specialize in particular modules, enhancing their expertise and productivity in those areas.


Testing in Software Engineering:
